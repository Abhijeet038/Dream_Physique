# Dream_Physique
The "dream physique" for most gym-goers often combines aesthetic balance, strength, and leanness. Here’s a quick breakdown of what it typically includes:

1. ProportionalMuscularity

Well-defined chest, broad shoulders, and a wide back (creating the V-taper look).

Strong, defined arms (biceps and triceps).

Developed legs (quads, hamstrings, and calves) to avoid the "skipped leg day" look.

2. Low Body Fat Percentage

Visible abs with a lean and athletic appearance, usually around 10-15% body fat for men and 18-22% for women.

3. Strength and Functionality

A physique that’s not just for show but capable of functional strength and endurance.

4. Balanced Symmetry

Equal focus on upper and lower body, avoiding overtraining one area at the expense of others.

#This physique varies based on individual goals, such as the lean and aesthetic "classic physique" look or the bulkier, stronger "powerbuilder" type.
